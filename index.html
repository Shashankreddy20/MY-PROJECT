Many corporate IT departments have green computing initiatives to reduce the environmental effect of their IT operations.</p><br>
            <p> Yet it is also clear that the environmental footprint of the sector is significant, estimated at 5-9% of the world's total electricity use and more than 2% of all emissions. Data centres and telecommunications will need to become more energy efficient, reuse waste energy, and use more renewable energy sources to stay competitive. Some believe they can and should become climate neutral by 2030.</p><br>
            <p> "(OECD) has published a survey of over 90 government and industry initiatives on "Green ICTs", i.e. information and communication technologies, the environment and climate change. The report concludes that initiatives tend to concentrate on the greening ICTs themselves rather than on their actual implementation to reduce global warming and "</p>

                <ol>
                   <div class="q"> <i><u>1.Energy Savings</u></i></div><br>
                   <p>Apart from computers, there are different kinds of electrical appliances that consume significant amount of energy. This creates a demand for the energy production. Therefore, it is necessary to decrease this energy crisis as much as possible for making a more eco-friendly environment. 
                    Green computing makes sure that very less amount of energy is consumed by the IT processes. Thus, this can save plenty amount of energy overtime.
                    
                    </p><br>
                   <div class="s"> <i><u>2. Cost Savings</u></i></div><br>
                <p>Green computing is highly cost effective that helps people save money. Since lots of energies are saved when using a green computing solution, it also substantially leads to financial gains. Even though green computing is with high upfront costs, still it is cost effective in the long run.
                </p><br>
                    <div class="h"><i><u>3. Recycling Process</u></i></div><br>
                    <p>Green computing encourages recycling process by reusing and recycling electronic wastes. Most parts of the computer are constructed using eco-friendly materials instead of plastic so that it can have less environmental impacts. This makes all the electronic wastes to get separated efficiently. Hence by implementing green computing strategies, companies overall can improve their recycling process.
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <div class="a"><i><u>4. Brand Strengthen</u></i></div><br>
                    <p>Some customers are so well concerned about the environment that they are solely preferring to go with companies that support green computing. Green computing is capable of creating public images so that they can strengthen their brand and market position all around the world. 
                    </p><br>
                  <div class="a"><i><u>5. Less Pollution </u></i></div>  <br>
                  <p>Through conventional computing, lots of pollution issues take place in the environment. For an example, if not properly recycled all the electronic wastes from the computer may end up circulating on land. Thus, leading to soil as well as water pollution. By using green computing, the users can minimize the impact created by pollution at least to some extent.
                </p><br>
                  <div class="a"> <i><u>6. Chemical Exposure</u></i></div><br>
                  <p>In most of the electronic devices, harmful chemicals such as mercury is used. If a human happens to get contacted with those substances, he/she will probably suffer from health risks. Some of the known health risks are triggering of immune responses, nerve damage or even cancer. The companies which practice green computing potentially avoid the use of non-toxic substances during the production of computer hardware.

                <h3>Disadvantages of Green Computing </h3>
                <br>
               <div class="a"><u>1. Implementation Cost</u></div><br>
               <p>Although green computing is cost effective in the long term, still many companies refrain from switching to green computing due to its high upfront cost. When implementing a green computing system, it takes lots of time and research, all that costs plenty of money. This makes the technology more expensive than the average model. 
               </p>
                <br>
                <div class="a"><u>2. Performance </u></div>
                <br> 
                <p>For those companies that are green are always considered to be underpowered both in terms of system performance and network. This is especially true, if it is not implemented properly. For the companies that relies upon powerful computers, this can drastically decrease their employee productivity which in turn affects the company's profit.
                </p><br>
                <div class="a"><u>3. Maintenance</u></div><br>
                <p>Besides implementation, the maintenance of a green computing system is considered to be highly difficult that can be costly as well as time consuming. This is because the technology behind green IT is entirely new and changing rapidly which makes the maintenance efforts eminent. 
                </p><br>
                <div class="a"><u>4. Adaptation </u></div><br>
                <p>The success of green computing does not solely depend on an individual person. It is based on the effort and preferences of each staff members. They must adopt to this new system. If one the members does not corporate to this, the implementation idea may go in vain. So just because of those people, firms must decide migrating to green computing.
                </p><br>
                <div class="a"><u>5. Security Leaks</u></div><br>
                <p>When using a green computing system, there are some serious concerns regarding security. The employee who work under companies that practice green computing regularly exchange their workstations and other devices. This eventually opens up many security leaks such as hacking. Therefore, the companies have to take necessary measures for avoiding such problems.
                </p><br>
                <div class="a"><u>6. IT Knowledge </u></div><br>
                <p>In order for using the green IT infrastructure, IT experts who has well knowledge about the technology needs to be deployed. Those experts are rare to find, and if found they need to be paid plenty of money. If not appointed, your systems could eventually experience downtimes and other technical issues.
